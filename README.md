# Data-Cleaning-and-Munging

Data Cleaning refers to removal of unwanted data and adding additional data derived from raw data to allow easy and efficient processing. 
Data Munging is a process for converting raw data into a form that renders it convenient for consumption by downstream applications and processes. 
Application of these two concepts on Kaggle Sqlite European Soccer Database and Data from Pew Research Centre was done thereby preparing the data to do the following:
(i) question answering 
(ii) change format to accommodate EDA 
(iii) understand data by plotting it,
and then standardize and attempt to normalize data for support further analysis. 

All these analysis was done using the various libraries of R.
